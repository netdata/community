## Details
Successful infrastructure monitoring enables IT teams to ensure constant uptime and the performance of their company’s systems. Technologies like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are beneficial to infrastructure monitoring by speeding up the analysis of data collected from all of the hardware and software components that comprise the IT stack. Infrastructure changes are occurring faster than ever before, but complex systems, the unique nature of applications and lack of IT skill sets can cause challenges when integrating with these newer technologies. It’s more important than ever that sysadmins, SREs and DevOps teams understand how ML and AI can mitigate these roadblocks, support them in staying on top of infrastructure performance and rapidly address issues that arise.

Join ML Lead Andrew Maguire, and Product Manager Shyam Sreevalsan, on the 23rd of June at 16:00 UTC for the Netdata Machine Learning Meetup, which will be livestreamed on Youtube.
