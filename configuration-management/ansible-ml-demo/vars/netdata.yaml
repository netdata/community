# Set Netdata Cloud claiming details. To find your `claim_token` and
# `claim_room`, go to Netdata Cloud, then click on your Space's name in the top
# navigation, then click on `Manage your Space`. Click on the `Nodes` tab in the
# panel that appears, which displays a script with `token` and `room` strings.
# Copy those strings into the variables below. `claim_url` should be
# `https://app.netdata.cloud`. Read more:
